# Dispersion scan LABVIEW program
I have made LABVIEW program for acquiring dispersion scan trace using ESP301 Newport stage and HR4000 USB spectrometer from OceanOptics. 

Labview driver and Firmware for ESP301 controller from Newport.

A simple and easy to implement technique for femtosecond pulse characterization is proposed and experimentally verified. It is based on the introduction of a known amount of dispersion (by controlling the number of passes through dispersive material) and subsequent recording of the spectral positions of second harmonic peaks obtained in a non-linear crystal. Such dependence allows for direct retrieval of the pulse spectral phase.

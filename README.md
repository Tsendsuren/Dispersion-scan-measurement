# Dispersion scan LABVIEW program
I have made LABVIEW program for acquiring dispersion scan trace using ESP301 Newport stage and HR4000 USB spectrometer from OceanOptics. 

Following files included and it's necessary to run the VI.
1. Labview driver and Firmware for ESP301 controller from Newport.
2. LABVIEW project file

## What is Dipsersion scan method?

A simple and easy to implement technique for femtosecond pulse characterization is proposed and experimentally verified. It is based on the introduction of a known amount of dispersion (by controlling the number of passes through dispersive material) and subsequent recording of the spectral positions of second harmonic peaks obtained in a non-linear crystal. Such dependence allows for direct retrieval of the pulse spectral phase.
